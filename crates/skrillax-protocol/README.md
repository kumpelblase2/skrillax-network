This crate provides a simple macro, `define_protocol!`, which generates a lot of the 
boilerplate involved in working with protocols. While it's not inherently complicated
to write that code manually, it becomes quite tedious for several packets and included
other protocols. Please see the [docs](https://docs.rs/skrillax-protocol/) for more 
information and usage information.
